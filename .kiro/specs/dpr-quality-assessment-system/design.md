# Design Document

## Overview

The AI-Powered DPR Quality Assessment and Risk Prediction System is designed as a comprehensive web-based platform that leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to automate the evaluation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER). The system follows a microservices architecture with modular components for document processing, AI analysis, geospatial verification, and user interaction.

The platform processes DPRs through a multi-stage pipeline: document ingestion and preprocessing, content extraction and standardization, AI-powered analysis across multiple evaluation modules, and presentation through an interactive dashboard. The system supports multilingual operations (English, Hindi, Assamese) and provides both online and offline functionality to accommodate varying connectivity conditions in Northeast India.
