# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered DPR Quality Assessment and Risk Prediction System is a comprehensive solution designed for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER) to automate the evaluation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). The system leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to assess DPR quality, predict project risks, compare costs against regional benchmarks, evaluate completion feasibility, and identify applicable government schemes. The system supports multiple languages (English, Hindi, Assamese) and provides both online and offline functionality for government officials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

4. WHEN a user attempts batch upload THEN the system SHALL accept up to 10 files simultaneously
5. WHEN an invalid file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message specifying accepted formats
6. WHEN file size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL display an error message with size restrictions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want the system to automatically extract and structure content from uploaded DPRs so that I can analyze standardized information regardless of the original document format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF contains scanned images THEN the system SHALL use OCR to extract text with at least 95% accuracy
2. WHEN processing any DPR THEN the system SHALL identify and classify sections including Executive Summary, Cost Estimate, Timeline, Resources, and Technical Specifications
3. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL remove irrelevant elements like headers, footers, and page numbers
4. WHEN a DPR is in Assamese or Hindi THEN the system SHALL detect the language and translate to English for processing
5. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve the original document structure and formatting context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want the system to automatically identify missing or incomplete sections in DPRs so that I can ensure all required information is present before approval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a DPR THEN the system SHALL compare extracted content against a predefined DPR checklist template
2. WHEN missing sections are detected THEN the system SHALL generate a gap analysis report listing all missing components
3. WHEN incomplete data is found THEN the system SHALL flag specific fields that require additional information
4. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicting information between sections
5. WHEN gap analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an overall completeness score as a percentage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want to compare DPR cost estimates against regional benchmarks so that I can identify potentially inflated or unrealistic pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing cost estimates THEN the system SHALL compare each line item against historical data from Northeast India projects
2. WHEN price variations exceed 20% above regional average THEN the system SHALL flag items as potentially overpriced
3. WHEN price variations exceed 20% below regional average THEN the system SHALL flag items as potentially underpriced
4. WHEN displaying comparisons THEN the system SHALL adjust for inflation, regional labor costs, and material variations
5. WHEN price analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable suggestions for cost optimization
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include bar charts comparing DPR estimates to regional averages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want to predict the likelihood of project completion within the proposed timeline so that I can assess project feasibility before approval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing project timelines THEN the system SHALL use machine learning models trained on historical Northeast India project data
2. WHEN calculating completion probability THEN the system SHALL consider resource allocation, technical complexity, and regional weather patterns
3. WHEN completion analysis is finished THEN the system SHALL provide a completion probability score as a percentage
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include an interactive "what-if" simulator for adjusting resources and timelines
5. WHEN probability is below 70% THEN the system SHALL highlight high-risk factors affecting completion
6. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest specific improvements to increase completion likelihood

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want the system to identify applicable government schemes for each DPR so that I can ensure proper funding alignment and scheme utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing DPR content THEN the system SHALL use NLP to match project descriptions against a comprehensive government schemes database
2. WHEN scheme matches are found THEN the system SHALL list all potentially applicable schemes with relevance scores
3. WHEN existing scheme references are detected THEN the system SHALL verify their accuracy and appropriateness
4. WHEN missing scheme opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest additional schemes that could support the project
5. WHEN scheme analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for optimizing scheme alignment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want to assess potential project risks so that I can make informed decisions about project approval and monitoring requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing risk analysis THEN the system SHALL evaluate cost overrun risks based on historical project outcomes
2. WHEN assessing timeline risks THEN the system SHALL predict delay probability using machine learning classifiers
3. WHEN analyzing environmental factors THEN the system SHALL identify potential environmental and regulatory risks
4. WHEN evaluating resources THEN the system SHALL assess resource shortage risks based on availability data
5. WHEN risk analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide risk scores (low/medium/high) with detailed reasoning
6. WHEN high risks are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend specific mitigation strategies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want to verify project site locations and assess their feasibility so that I can ensure projects are planned for appropriate and accessible locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPS coordinates are provided in DPRs THEN the system SHALL verify locations using mapping APIs
2. WHEN coordinates are missing THEN the system SHALL attempt to geocode project addresses
3. WHEN location verification is complete THEN the system SHALL assess site accessibility and infrastructure availability
4. WHEN environmental restrictions exist THEN the system SHALL flag potential regulatory or environmental constraints
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide interactive map visualization with project site markers
6. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for location clarification

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official, I want to access a comprehensive dashboard that summarizes all DPR assessments so that I can quickly understand project status and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display DPR completeness scores, feasibility ratings, and risk levels
2. WHEN viewing price comparisons THEN the system SHALL show visual charts highlighting cost variations from regional benchmarks
3. WHEN reviewing completion predictions THEN the system SHALL display probability scores with supporting factors
4. WHEN examining scheme matches THEN the system SHALL list applicable schemes with relevance indicators
5. WHEN using interactive features THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates to the what-if simulator
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support export to PDF and Excel formats
7. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL display all content in the selected language (English, Hindi, Assamese)

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a MDoNER official working in areas with limited internet connectivity, I want to use the system offline so that I can continue DPR assessments without network dependency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function using cached models and historical data
2. WHEN operating offline THEN the system SHALL provide all core assessment features including price comparison and risk prediction
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize offline work and update cached data
4. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the operational status to users
